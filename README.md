# Provizora
The word Provizora comes from the Esperanto word for temporary.
The name was picked because this project is meant to be temporary until a fully Rust project can take hold.
This will lay the groundwork for the Rust project and will help launch its success.
But why an Esperanto word? 
Esperanto was created to be easy to use, easy to learn language made for the purpose of bringing others together through easy to understand communication.
I like that message and feel like this project, in the long term, can play the role of an easy to use firmware that can bring the drone world together.

# Functional Differences From BF
- Anti-gravity only effects the pterm instead of the pterm and iterm.
- Improved sensor fusion method for dual gyro FC.
- AHRS (attitude estimation) uses raw instead of filtered gyro.
- Gyro lowpass filters replaced with predictive lowpass filters.
- Two tap arming by default.
- Soft arming by default, with a lower motor idle while in soft arming.
- Mixer learns the CG location and adds a direct compensation for it.
- Detection of collisions reducing the "freakout" the happens. Requires ACC to be enabled to work.
- If a full collision is detected at near 0 throttle, re-enable soft arming, makes landing simple.
- Custom mixer setups are now done differently (more information to come)

# Changelog
### 1/26/2024
- Refactor entire mixer and replace with my own mixer.
- Mixer currently only supports 4 motor outputs.
- Mixer refactoring better support soft arming.
- Custom motor mixes are now handled slightly differently.
- New mixer settings:
  - `thrust_linear_low` with a default of 60
  - `thrust_linear_high` with a default of 30
    - thrust linear now works like EmuFlight https://github.com/emuflight/EmuFlight/wiki/Motor-Mixers-and-Thrust-Linearization
    - set both to 0 to disable.
  - `thrust_linear_cut` with a default of 75
    - This is the cutoff to a pt1 filter on the amount that thrust linear changes the throttle. This should help with low throttle noise that thrust linear amplifies on motors.
    - Set to 0 to disable.
  - `motor_cut_low` with a default of 350
  - `motor_cut_high` with a default of 750
    - Motor cut is a cutoff to a pt1 filter on the motor output themselves.
    - The cutoff shifts as the demanded motor output changes, with low occurring at 0 throttle and high at full throttle.
- RPM filter accuracy is increased.
- CG compensation is added, it uses Iterm and thrust to estimate CG.
- The CG is fed into the mixer and should better compensate for thrust imbalance.
- `anti_gravity_gain` is reduced from 80 to 20 by default (CG compensation handles this now).
- New CG Compensation settings:
  - `cg_learning_time` with a default of 20
    - Learning time is the time in tenths of a second that it takes the mixer to learn 70% of the CG.
    - As CG is learning Iterm is attenuated as CG Compensation largely replaces its role.
    - If your drone is tuned well without any Iterm related issues, lower values may make it respond better to outside stimulus.
- New CG Compensation debug:
  - `CG_COMPENSATION` is the new debug mode
  - Element 0 is the estimated relative x CG
  - Element 1 is the estimated relative y CG
  - Element 2 is motor 0 thrust gain (CG Compensation changes this)
  - Element 3 is motor 1 thrust gain (CG Compensation changes this)
  - Element 4 is motor 2 thrust gain (CG Compensation changes this)
  - Element 5 is motor 3 thrust gain (CG Compensation changes this)
- Collision Detection is added and uses the accelerometer to determine if you have collided with anything.
- When a collision is detected the mixer will begin to only allow for thrust, and no pitch, roll or yaw.
- New Collision Detection settings:
  - `collision_jerk_start` with a default of 350
  - `collision_jerk_end` with a default of 550
    - The derivative of the accelerometer (jerk) is used to determine when we have collided.
    - The amount that the mixer allows for pitch, roll, and yaw is determined by how much jerk is measured.
    - When the jerk becomes higher than `collision_jerk_start` it will start to limit them, and at `collision_jerk_end` it will completely limit them.
    - If the jerk is greater than the `collision_jerk_end` and throttle is low (less than 1%) soft arming is re-enabled.
- New Collision Detection debug:
  - `COLLISION_DETECTION` is the new debug mode
  - Element 0 is the measured jerk, or derivative of the accelerometer
  - Element 1 is the allowed mixer range for roll, pitch and yaw, multiplied by 1000.
    - A value of 1000 is full roll, pitch and yaw control.
    - A value of 0 is no roll, pitch and yaw control, only throttle control.
- All the new settings are available in the CLI or OSD under the new mixer tab of pid tuning.
- BF version bump to 4.6.4

### 10/24/2024
- Major lowpas filtering overhaul!
- Removal of Predictive filter variants, now all lowpass filters can be optionally made predictive.
- Lowpass filter variants are now `"OFF", "PT1", "PT2", "PT3", "FIRST_ORDER", "SECOND_ORDER", "SLIDING_ORDER", "PT_SECOND_ORDER"`
- `gyro_lpf1_variant` is for the main filter
- `gyro_lpf1_pred_variant` is for the predictive portion of the filter. If you set this to `OFF` then there will be no predictive part to the filter and it will act like normal.
- `gyro_lpf1_pred_weight` is how much of the prediction you want to use. It is set as a percent, with 0 disabling the prediction and 100 being full predictive strength.
- `SLIDING_ORDER` is a lowpass filter that can be configured to be between a `FIRST_ORDER` and `SECOND_ORDER` filter. It does make use of `Q`. The setting `gyro_lpf1_cutoff_shift` determine how much like a `FIRST_ORDER` or `SECOND_ORDER` filter it is. A value of 0 is like a `FIRST_ORDER`, and a value of 100 is like a `SECOND_ORDER`. This applies for the predictive part as well.
- `PT_SECOND_ORDER` is a lowpass filter that can be configured to be between a `PT1` and `SECOND_ORDER` filter. It does make use of `Q`. The setting `gyro_lpf1_cutoff_shift` determine how much like a `FIRST_ORDER` or `SECOND_ORDER` filter it is. A value of 0 is like a `PT1`, and a value of 100 is like a `SECOND_ORDER`. This applies for the predictive part as well.
- BF version bump to 4.6.1

### 10/22/2024
- Prevent lowpass filters from being set above nyquist and causing issues.
- Fix blackbox logging (probably) and add the new lowpass settings to blackbox.
- make the AHRS use raw gyro input instead of filtered gyro, this should make the attitude estimation more accurate.

### 10/20/2024
- Remove the BF gyro lowpass filters and replace with my own.
- Added a median filter as a downsampling filter to remove BF's lpf2 downsampling
- Add lowpass filter options of off, pt1, pt2, pt3, first order, second order, predictive pt1, predictive first order, predictive second order.
- Setting cutoff to 0 will not set the filter to off, you instead need to set the filter variant to off
- All new settings are found in the OSD under the gyro filters tab
- All predictive filters are a lowpass filter with another lowpass filter on the error between the filter and the raw input. Example, if your raw input is 50.1, but the filter output is 25.1, then the error would be 25.0 and there would be an additional filter being fed that value. It then adds its output together with the main lowpass filter. This "predictive" part is able to remove latency at the cost of a little additional noise at lower frequencies. The higher the predictive cutoff the less latency, but more noise you will have.
- Below are the new settings:
  - `gyro_lpf1_cutoff` -> Filter cutoff for the first lowpass filter
  - `gyro_lpf1_pred_cutoff` -> The cutoff for the predictive part of the filter. Higher values will remove latency faster, but may also lead to more noise.
  - `gyro_lpf1_q` -> Q value for the lowpass filter. Only applies to second order filters (both predictive and non predictive). A value of 707 will mimic a BF "biquad" filter. Higher values is less latent with a bit less filtering around cutoff, and lower values are more latent with more filtering around cutoff. Values greater than 707 will start to increase noise just below the cutoff.
  - `gyro_lpf1_pred_q` -> Q value for the predictive part of the lowpass filter. Only applies to the predictive second order filter
  - `gyro_lpf1_variant` -> Sets which filter variant you will be using. pt1, pt2, pt3 are what you expect them to be. first order is a lowpass filter that filters slightly more than a pt1, mainly at very high frequencies. second order is the BF biquad filter.
- Options are the same for the `gyro_lpf2`

### 10/15/2024
- Remove iterm from anti-gravity, rejoice!
- Modify `DEBUG_DUAL_GYRO` to display the sensor fusion. 

Debug 0: first gyro roll  
Debug 1: first gyro roll noise  
Debug 2: second gyro roll  
Debug 3: second gyro roll noise  
Debug 4: first gyro pitch  
Debug 5: first gyro pitch noise  
Debug 6: second gyro pitch  
Debug 7: second gyro pitch noise

### 10/13/2024
- Remove gyro overflow protection (sounds scary but few gyros implement this). Removed as I don't plan on implementing this logic into the Rust PID loop logic.
- For FC with dual gyros of the same type added smarter sensor fusion. Adding one new parameter `gyro_noise_est_cut`. 
It can be found in the OSD labeled `GYRO NOISE CUT` in the `FILTER GLB`.
This parameter is a filter on the "noise" of each gyro. The more "noisy" gyro will be weighted less when fusing the gyros together. 
A lower cutoff will mean that the weighting will switch between gyros slower.
- TODO modify the existing `DEBUG_DUAL_GYRO_DIFF` to make it useful for viewing the noise of each sensor.

## News

### Requirements for the submission of new and updated targets

The following new requirements for pull requests adding new targets or modifying existing targets are put in place from now on:

1. Read the [hardware specification](https://betaflight.com/docs/development/manufacturer/manufacturer-design-guidelines)

2. No new F3 based targets will be accepted;

3. For any new target that is to be added, only a Unified Target config into https://github.com/betaflight/unified-targets/tree/master/configs/default needs to be submitted. See the [instructions](https://betaflight.com/docs/manufacturer/creating-an-unified-target) for how to create a Unified Target configuration. If there is no Unified Target for the MCU type of the new target (see instructions above), then a 'legacy' format target definition into `src/main/target/` has to be submitted as well;

4. For changes to existing targets, the change needs to be applied to the Unified Target config in https://github.com/betaflight/unified-targets/tree/master/configs/default. If no Unified Target configuration for the target exists, a new Unified Target configuration will have to be created and submitted. If there is no Unified Target for the MCU type of the new target (see instructions above), then an update to the 'legacy' format target definition in `src/main/target/` has to be submitted alongside the update to the Unified Target configuration.

## Translators

We want to make Betaflight accessible for pilots who are not fluent in English, and for this reason we are currently maintaining translations into 21 languages for Betaflight Configurator: Català, Dansk, Deutsch, Español, Euskera, Français, Galego, Hrvatski, Bahasa Indonesia, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Latviešu, Português, Português Brasileiro, polski, Русский язык, Svenska, 简体中文, 繁體中文.
We have got a team of volunteer translators who do this work, but additional translators are always welcome to share the workload, and we are keen to add additional languages. If you would like to help us with translations, you have got the following options:
- if you help by suggesting some updates or improvements to translations in a language you are familiar with, head to [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/betaflight-configurator) and add your suggested translations there;
- if you would like to start working on the translation for a new language, or take on responsibility for proof-reading the translation for a language you are very familiar with, please head to the Betaflight Discord chat (registration [here](https://discord.gg/n4E6ak4u3c)), and join the ['translation'](https://discord.com/channels/868013470023548938/1057773726915100702) channel - the people in there can help you to get a new language added, or set you up as a proof reader.

## Hardware Issues

Betaflight does not manufacture or distribute their own hardware. While we are collaborating with and supported by a number of manufacturers, we do not do any kind of hardware support.
If you encounter any hardware issues with your flight controller or another component, please contact the manufacturer or supplier of your hardware, or check RCGroups https://rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2464844 to see if others with the same problem have found a solution.
